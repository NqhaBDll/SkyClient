Is this safe?

Just in general, never ask the developers of a program if their program is a virus. Why would they ever say yes? As developers we aren't dumb enough to make an open source program a virus. If you trust all the creators of the mods on SkyClient, well, they trusted us enough to allow us to use their mods.
